# Candy Rush

This is a demonstration of the popular game [Asteroids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) - with a twist.
Instead of destroying the candies (asteroids in the classic iteration), you create more candies when you
hit them. The goal of the game is to have 100 candies on the screen before you run out of lives.
You can find it online at [Candy Rush](http://asteroidspewpewpew.herokuapp.com/).
